# ReitOS

Welcome to ReitOS, the real life? version of Reito Aoba's operating system. 

ReitOS is a Touhou Danmakufu ph3 script that aims to mimic a proper operating system (without being one, of course). It's primarily a proof-of-concept, though if I can get things to work, it may actually be useful (beyond being a gag, of course).

# Usage

This project is still in its infancy. However, it is possible to use the provided copy of Danmakufu (`ReitOS.exe`) to run ReitOS.

# Built-in Libraries and Applications

### Libraries
All libraries in ReitOS are either sourced from other repositories (marked with the appropriate release tag) or only exist in the ReitOS repository, in which case they will be marked as such.

# Contributing

Once this system is up and running, I'll consider features, etc.

However, for now, contributions are bug-report only. Please use GitHub Issues for bug reports (if you're crazy enough to be running this to begin with).

Refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for details on how ReitOS works and how to write applications for it.
